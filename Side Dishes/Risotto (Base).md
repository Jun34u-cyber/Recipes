	Stir until rice is coated in oil and golden in color (~2 min)
**2.5)** Deglaze Pan (optional)

	**Notes**
		Continue adding broth until the rice is al dente. This may take about an hour.
		Most recipes recommend 4 cups broth for every 1 cup of rice, but I always need more broth.
			I warm up about 6 cups for every 1 cup of rice but sometimes have leftovers.

	Stir in butter, cheese, or anything else you would like.
