		**Note**: Do not wash the rice for this dish

	**Notes**
		Continue adding broth until the rice is al dente. This may take about an hour.
		Most recipes recommend 4 cups broth for every 1 cup of rice, but I always need more broth.
			I warm up about 6 cups for every 1 cup of rice but sometimes have leftovers.
